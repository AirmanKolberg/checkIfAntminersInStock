# checkIfAntminersInStock
A quick and simple Python script (designed for the 2015 15" MacBook Pro) that will check to see if the Antminer S19 Pro is in stock, and will notify through an E-Mail.  Specifically, GMail services, but without a need for their API.  If your screen's dimensions differ, you will have to adjust some of the x and y PyAutoGUI variables, but it's pretty straightforward.
